# spacr
Spatial phenotype analysis of crisp screens (spacr). A collection of functions for generating measurtement and classefication data from microscopy images from high content imaging screens.

Features:

 - Finetuning cellpose
 - Generating masks with cellpose
 - Cropping single cell images
 - Annotating single cell images
 - Training torch models (CNNs or transformers) to classify single cell images
 - Analyze phenotype data and sequencing data in CRISPR spatial phenotype screens
 - Simulating spatial phenotype screens
